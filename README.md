# Robotics-Programming-Project
University robotics programming project using Python

This project focuses on designing and simulating an autonomous mobile robot in a virtual environment using Gazebo. Both the robot model and the virtual world were fully designed and developed from scratch
The robot is equipped with a LIDAR sensor, which enables it to scan the surrounding environment and detect obstacles. Based on the sensor data, an autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance algorithm was implemented, allowing the robot to move independently without any manual control or keyboard input.

The robot makes real-time movement decisions by processing LIDAR readings and adjusting its direction and speed accordingly. This ensures safe navigation within the environment while avoiding collisions.
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate autonomous control, sensor-based navigation, and robotic simulation. This project was developed as part of a university coursework.

Key Features:

Fully autonomous robot (no manual or keyboard control)
Custom-designed virtual environment
Custom-built robot model
